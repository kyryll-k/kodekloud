Create a pod named webserver.

Create an emptyDir volume shared-logs.

Create two containers from nginx and ubuntu images with latest tag only and remember to mention tag i.e nginx:latest, nginx container name should be nginx-container and ubuntu container name should be sidecar-container on webserver pod.

Add command on sidecar-container "sh","-c","while true; do cat /var/log/nginx/access.log /var/log/nginx/error.log; sleep 30; done"

Mount the volume shared-logs on both containers at location /var/log/nginx, all containers should be up and running.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.
